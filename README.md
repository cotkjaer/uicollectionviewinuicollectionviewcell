UICollectionView in an UICollectionViewCell using Storyboard
======================================

This is an example of an UICollectionView in an UICollectionViewCell using only Storyboard (no xibs).

There are two UICollectionViewControllers; an inner and an outer. Both have a matching set of UICollectionViews and UICollectionViewCells

The outer controller does a bit of half-screen paging.
